# Base64 Encoder and Decoder

A simple and secure Base64 encoder and decoder tool for all users. Unlike other encoders, this tool decodes and encodes Base64 **client-side**, so your data is 100% safe and never sent to any server.

## Features

- **Base64 Encoding**: Encodes the input text into Base64 format.
- **Base64 Decoding**: Decodes the Base64-encoded text back to its original form.
- **Client-Side Processing**: All encoding and decoding are done on the client-side, ensuring your data remains private.
- **Theme Toggling**: Switch between light and dark themes for better user experience.
- **Copy Output**: Copy the output text to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Clear Fields**: Clear both input and output fields with one click.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, including light and dark themes.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the encoding/decoding logic, clipboard functionality, and theme switching.
